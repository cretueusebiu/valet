Acrylic DNS Proxy
==============================================================================

Acrylic is a local DNS proxy for Windows which improves the performance of
your computer by actively caching the responses coming from your DNS servers
and helps you fight unwanted ads through the use of a custom HOSTS file
(optimized for handling hundreds of thousands of domain names) with support
for wildcards and regular expressions.

When you browse a web page a portion of the loading time is dedicated to name
resolution (usually from a few milliseconds to 1 second or more) while the
rest is dedicated to the transfer of the web page contents and resources to
your browser. What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name
resolution for frequently visited addresses closest to zero possible. It may
not seem such a great optimization but in a few weeks of Internet browsing you
will probably save an hour or so, which is definitely not such a bad thing.
Furthermore Acrylic's sliding expiration caching mechanism and DNS silent
updates are able to improve the browsing experience independently of the
browser.

With Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome downtimes of your DNS servers
without disrupting your work, because in that case you will at least be able
to connect to your favourite websites and to your email server.

Another good thing is that Acrylic is released as open source, which means
that it's free and its source code, written with Borland Delphi 7, is freely
available to anyone under the GNU General Public License.
